# Chase-the-thieves-

This is a simple stimulation which depicts how the characters in any game react when they are trained to behave when coming in contact or at a certain distance from some other object.
Here, the player is a cop and the player can move the cop using the arrow keys. The left and right arrow keys to turn left or right while the front and back keys to move forward or backwards.
